% string_similarity() Compares how similar two strings are
%   The strings can be of different lengths, but that will increase the

% INPUTS
%    s1  - First string to compare
%    s2  - Second strong to compare
%    len - How many characters to compare
%          Set to 0 to compare all
% OUTPUTS
%    matchPercentage - A percentage for how many characters match
%                      Value is a float between 0 and 1
%    charsMatch      - The absolute number of matching characters
%    charsDiff       - The absolute number of differing characters
%    charsTotal      - How many characters were compared
